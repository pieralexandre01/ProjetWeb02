                                Massie, and Pier-Alexandre Auger-Matteau, during their training in Web Design and
                                Programming at Cégep de Saint-Jérôme. Their goal was to create an online festival that
                                would celebrate technological advances while promoting moral and ethical use of
                                technology.</p>
